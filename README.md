`workflow-auth` is a service for authentication and getting session tokens.

The authentication service is responsible for verifying the identity of users attempting to access the client app. 
This includes validating user credentials, such as email address and password, and providing secure access to the app's features and functionality.

## Description

The main functions of this authentication service include the following:

- This service writes/reads session tokens in the database.
- PostgreSQL is used as a database.
- In order to reduce the risk of compromise of personal data, the service does not store any data associated with users: only user GUIDs, as well as tables directly related to authentication ("session token", "temporary sign up", "suspicious sign up").
- Only the "code check" table is stored on the client application.
- Any new login to the application updates the expiration date of the session token.

More detailed description of the service is presented at [this link](docs/description.md).
